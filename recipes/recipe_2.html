        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>(optional) dry flavoring like salt, herbs etc</li>
            <li>(optional) wet flavoring like soy sauce, vinegar, etc</li>
            <li>Vegetables, potatoes, any other add-ons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken with dry and perhaps wet flavorings. Leave in the fridge overnight, or, in a pinch, for an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Put the oil in the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the things that take a while to cook (potatoes, for instance) first. Flavor those with dry flavorings.</li>
            <li>You can put the wet flavorings into the pan now or later depending on if you want them to be a sauce. Depending on how thick you want it, put flour or cornstarch in.</li>
            <li>Once you put the chicken in, things become super time sensitive.</li>
            <li>Put the stuff that cooks super quick, or the stuff that you want to stay crunchy, last.</li>
        </ol>
